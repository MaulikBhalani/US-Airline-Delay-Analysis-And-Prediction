# **US airline delay analysis and prediction**

## Objective
The project deals with the prediction of the USA airline delay based on the analysis of flight characteristics like traffic and weather at different times of years based on the previously available dataset.

## Concepts implemented
Big data concepts (for analysis): Apache Spark and Hadoop. 

Machine learning and statistics (for prediction): logistic regression, z-score.

## Configuration needed
-	Apache Spark configuration 
-	mpl_tookits.basemap (in case of an error for graph plotting) 
Try: ```pip install git+https://github.com/matplotlib/basemap```

## Steps to run
Step 1:  ```Download the zip file```<br />
Step 2: ```Extract the file```<br />
Step 3: ```Upload the .ipynb file to google colab```<br />
step 4: ```Run all```

## Walkthrough 


### The size represents the traffic airport traffic and the colour mark represents the amount of delay

**The lines represent the origin and the destination of the flight.** 
**Darker the line, the higher the possibility of delay.**
